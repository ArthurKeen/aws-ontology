## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-26

First release under the [Arango Solutions](https://github.com/arango-solutions-org) GitHub
organization, with a permanent namespace.

### Changed (breaking)
- **Permanent namespace.** The ontology IRI moves from the provisional Protégé default
  `http://www.semanticweb.org/aws-ontology` to `https://w3id.org/arango-solutions/aws-ontology`
  (terms: `https://w3id.org/arango-solutions/aws-ontology#`). Added
  `owl:versionIRI <https://w3id.org/arango-solutions/aws-ontology/0.6.0>`. Redirect rules for
  w3id.org live in `w3id/`.
- **`hasResource` split.** It was overloaded for API Gateway resources *and* IAM policy
  statement resources. `hasResource` now relates only `APIGateway` → `APIGatewayResource`; the
  new `hasStatementResource` relates `PolicyStatement` → `Resource`.
- **IAM identity hierarchy.** New `IAMIdentity` (users, groups, roles) and `IAMEntity` (users,
  roles), using AWS's own terms. `IAMGroup` is now a subclass of `IAMIdentity`; `IAMUser` and
  `IAMRole` are subclasses of `IAMEntity`. `hasPolicyAttachment` (and its equivalent
  `hasPolicy`) has domain `IAMIdentity`; `hasPermissionBoundary` and `canAssumeRole` have
  domain `IAMEntity`.
- `examples.ttl` is now its own ontology, `https://w3id.org/arango-solutions/aws-ontology/examples`,
  importing the main ontology by IRI (it previously redeclared the main ontology IRI and
  imported `<file:aws.owl>`). `ontology/catalog-v001.xml` resolves the imports locally in Protégé.

### Fixed
- **Ontology + examples were logically inconsistent.** HermiT reported the combination as
  inconsistent: 15 example individuals were entailed into disjoint categories. Causes:
  - multiple `rdfs:domain` values on `hasResource`, `hasPolicyAttachment`, and
    `hasPermissionBoundary` (OWL reads these as an *intersection*, so every API Gateway was
    inferred to be a policy statement, every IAM user a group and a role, and so on);
  - the security-group rule example used the IAM-only `memberOf`; it now uses the new
    `securityGroupRuleOf` / `hasSecurityGroupRule` (sub-property of `contains`);
  - two `appliesTo` example triples pointed the wrong way (resource → security group);
  - `cidrBlock` was restricted to `NetworkingResource`, though security group rules and network
    ACL entries also carry CIDR blocks; its domain is now `AWSResource`.
- **`tools/import_to_arangodb.py` could not import anything.** It assigned the boolean
  returned by `create_database()` to the database handle, and called a non-existent
  `ArangoRDF.insert_rdf()`. It now uses ArangoRDF's `rdf_to_arangodb_by_pgt` / `_rpt` / `_lpg`
  (new `--model` and `--graph-name` options, PGT by default), its `--test-queries` match the
  PGT layout and fail the run when the graph is empty, and it reads `ARANGO_HOST`,
  `ARANGO_USERNAME`, and `ARANGO_DATABASE`.
- `tools/propose_ontology_updates.py` now uses `claude-opus-5-5` with explicit effort and the
  server-side refusal fallback.
- Documentation counts, Python version (3.11+), serialization name (RDF/XML), and the AQL and
  SPARQL examples now match the code. `docs/ARANGODB_INTEGRATION.md` and
  `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` were rewritten to document only real APIs and variables, and
  no longer suggest a default database password.

### Removed
- Unused runtime dependencies `owlready2` (now a dev dependency, for HermiT) and `requests`;
  `anthropic` moved to the optional `monitor` dependency group.
- `PRIVATE_REPO_TEMPLATE.md` and `docs/CODE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (internal planning
  documents), and the maintainer's local AI-assistant harness (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`,
  `CLAUDE.md`) from version control.

### Added
- `tests/test_consistency.py`: a HermiT OWL 2 DL consistency check over ontology + examples
  (required in CI), a fast disjointness-clash check, and a lint that rejects intersection
  domains/ranges.
- `tests/test_arangodb_import.py`: an end-to-end import of all three ArangoRDF models into a
  live ArangoDB (a service container in CI).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CITATION.cff`, issue and PR templates, Dependabot,
  `.mailmap`, and a non-affiliation disclaimer; the ontology header now carries
  `dcterms:publisher` and `dcterms:license`.
- **Ontology-level provenance annotations (PRD v2.0, REQ-040)**: `dcterms:source`/`creator`/
  `contributor`/`created`/`modified`/`description` on the `owl:Ontology` header, plus two new local
  annotation properties, `:provenanceMethod` and `:verificationMethod`, declaring machine-readably
  how the ontology was authored (`domain-knowledge-authored-and-verified` — modeled from AWS public
  documentation and API reference knowledge, NOT extracted from a fixed ingested document corpus
  and NOT derived from live AWS API introspection) and how it was independently checked afterward
  (`owl-dl-reasoning`, `shacl-validation`, `automated-test-suite`). Motivated by a concrete external
  finding: an ontology-import tool (arango-ontoextract) was scoring this ontology's Faithfulness
  and Semantic Validity as blank/failing because those signals are LLM-judge outputs tied to
  document-extraction provenance a hand-authored ontology never has — these annotations let a
  consumer distinguish "no provenance available" from "authored and verified by a different,
  non-document-grounded method." 160 classes unchanged; 2181→2199 triples (metadata only, no new
  resource classes). PRD REQ-040.
- **PRD v1.9**: one `new-requirement` patch (REQ-039) for the round-5 expansion below, proposed
  via `/prd-sync` and accepted; the §3 Future scope subsection is now removed entirely (empty —
  every item from the original modernization roadmap has been implemented and reconciled)
- **Service coverage expansion round 5**: Cognito federation providers beyond user pools —
  `CognitoIdentityProvider` (SAML/OIDC/social provider configured inside a user pool, no `:arn`,
  same sub-resource discipline as `Route53RecordSet`) under `:IdentityResource`, plus
  `IAMSAMLProvider` and `IAMOIDCProvider` (the OTHER federation path: IAM identity-provider trusts
  attached directly to a Cognito identity pool, which DO have real ARNs) — 160 classes total (was
  157), 153 object + 119 datatype properties, 2,181 triples. This was the last item on the original
  PRD §3 Future-scope roadmap; the section is now empty. New examples wire into both existing
  Cognito individuals from the original backfill round: `AppUserPool` gains a Google sign-in
  provider, `AppIdentityPool` gains a direct SAML federation. PRD REQ-039.
- **PRD v1.8**: one `new-requirement` patch (REQ-038) for the round-4 expansion below, proposed
  via `/prd-sync` and accepted
- **Service coverage expansion round 4**: AWS WAF (`WAFWebACL`, `WAFRuleGroup`, `WAFIPSet` under
  `:SecurityResource`), AWS Config (`ConfigRule`, `ConfigurationRecorder`, `ConfigConformancePack`
  under `:MonitoringResource`), AWS Direct Connect (`DirectConnectGateway`,
  `DirectConnectConnection`, `DirectConnectVirtualInterface` under `:NetworkingResource`), and a
  new `:DeploymentResource` category (disjoint from the other 10) for AWS CloudFormation
  (`CloudFormationStack`, `CloudFormationStackSet`, `CloudFormationChangeSet`) and AWS CodePipeline
  (`CodePipelinePipeline`, `CodePipelineStage`) — 157 classes total (was 142), 151 object + 118
  datatype properties, 2,152 triples. Reused the existing generic `:appliesTo` (WebACL → protected
  resource) and `:complianceStatus` properties instead of inventing redundant ones. New examples
  wire into 3 existing individuals from prior rounds: a CloudFormation stack now provisions the
  existing `WebServerInstance`, a Config rule evaluates the existing `ProductionVPC`, and a new
  Direct Connect gateway attaches into the existing `MainTransitGateway` — fulfilling the
  `TransitGatewayAttachment` class comment's original mention of Direct Connect gateways.
  `ConfigurationRecorder` and `CodePipelineStage` deliberately have no `:arn` (verified against
  each service's documented IAM resource types — account/region-level singleton settings and
  pipeline-internal sub-objects aren't independently ARNed). Caught a real name collision before
  it shipped: a draft `:hasStage` for CodePipeline would have collided with the existing
  `APIGateway`-scoped `:hasStage`, entailing a disjointness contradiction between
  `:DeploymentResource` and `:IntegrationResource` under OWL DL — renamed to `:hasPipelineStage`.
  SHACL warnings 45→47 (the two new no-ARN individuals), fully explained in
  `ontology/aws.shapes.ttl`'s header, which was also backfilled with the no-ARN types from rounds
  2–3 that had never been retroactively documented there. PRD REQ-038.
- **PRD v1.7**: one `new-requirement` patch (REQ-037) for the round-3 analytics expansion below,
  proposed via `/prd-sync` once `arangodb-memory-mcp` write access returned, and accepted
- **Service coverage expansion round 3**: a new `:AnalyticsResource` category (disjoint from the
  other 9, justified the same way `:AIResource` was) covering AWS Glue (`GlueDatabase`,
  `GlueTable`, `GlueCrawler`, `GlueJob`), Amazon Athena (`AthenaWorkGroup`, `AthenaDataCatalog`,
  `AthenaQueryExecution`), Amazon Kinesis (`KinesisStream`, `KinesisFirehoseDeliveryStream`,
  `KinesisAnalyticsApplication`), Amazon EMR (`EMRCluster`, `EMRStep`, `EMRNotebook`), and Amazon
  OpenSearch Service (`OpenSearchDomain`, `OpenSearchIndex`) — 142 classes total (was 126), 139
  object + 112 datatype properties, 1982 triples. Example instances form one coherent clickstream
  pipeline spanning all five services rather than disconnected one-offs. `AthenaQueryExecution`,
  `EMRStep`, and `OpenSearchIndex` deliberately have no `:arn`, verified against each service's
  documented IAM resource types rather than assumed. PRD REQ-037.
- **PRD v1.6**: four `new-requirement` patches (REQ-033–036) for the round-2 service expansion
  below, proposed via `/prd-sync` and accepted
- **Service coverage expansion round 2**: Amazon Route 53 (`Route53HostedZone`, `Route53RecordSet`,
  `Route53HealthCheck`), AWS Transit Gateway (`TransitGateway`, `TransitGatewayAttachment`,
  `TransitGatewayRouteTable`), Amazon ElastiCache (`ElastiCacheCluster`,
  `ElastiCacheReplicationGroup`), and AWS Systems Manager (`SSMParameter`, `SSMDocument`,
  `SSMPatchBaseline`) — 126 classes total (was 115), 128 object + 107 datatype properties, 1816
  triples. Same accuracy discipline as prior rounds: `Route53RecordSet` deliberately has no `:arn`
  (record sets aren't independently ARN-addressable in real AWS). Remaining §3 roadmap items
  (analytics, WAF/Config, CloudFormation/IaC, CodePipeline) deferred to a future round.
- **Agentic ontology-coverage monitor**: `.github/workflows/ontology-monitor.yml` (weekly cron +
  manual dispatch) + `tools/propose_ontology_updates.py` — checks the AWS "What's New" feed against
  the PRD's own declared scope using Claude, opens a PR with draft proposals when it finds
  something new (never edits `ontology/aws.ttl` directly). Replaces the broken `automation/` daemon
  (marked deprecated, not deleted — see `automation/README.md`). Requires an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  repo secret. PRD REQ-032.
- **Service coverage expansion**: AWS Organizations & Control Tower (`Organization`,
  `OrganizationalUnit`, `ControlTowerLandingZone`), Amazon Cognito (`CognitoUserPool`,
  `CognitoUserPoolClient`, `CognitoIdentityPool`), GuardDuty & Security Hub
  (`GuardDutyDetector`/`Finding`, `SecurityHubHub`/`StandardsSubscription`), and Amazon SageMaker
  (`NotebookInstance`, `Model`, `Endpoint`, `TrainingJob`, the latter also `prov:Activity`) —
  115 classes total (was 101), 121 object + 103 datatype properties, 1712 triples
- **PRD v1.4**: four `new-requirement` patches (REQ-028–031) proposed via the new bidirectional
  `/prd-sync` protocol and accepted, promoting the four service areas above from §3's roadmap
  into numbered requirements
- **Example data completeness** (closes drift alerts REQ-018-arn-completeness and
  REQ-018-policy-statement-coverage): backfilled `:arn` on all 70 example individuals whose AWS
  type has a real ARN, including 7 real public AWS-managed-policy ARNs (`AmazonEKSClusterPolicy`,
  `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`, etc.); added 7 new `:PolicyStatement` individuals mirroring existing
  `:policyDocument` JSON, linked via `:hasStatement`. SHACL warnings dropped from 110 to 40 — the
  remainder is individuals of types confirmed to have no real AWS ARN (regions, availability
  zones, policy statements, trust policies, etc.) or AWS-managed policies whose content is owned
  by AWS, both expected by design rather than a backlog (see `ontology/aws.shapes.ttl` header)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **AI/Generative AI resources** (PRD REQ-022): `AIResource` category with `FoundationModel`,
  `BedrockAgent`, `BedrockKnowledgeBase`, `BedrockGuardrail`, `BedrockDataSource`, and
  `ModelInvocation`, plus `invokesModel`/`usesKnowledgeBase`/`ingestsDataSource`/`hasGuardrail`/
  `invocationOf` properties and example instances
- **IAM Identity Center resources** (PRD REQ-023): `IdentityCenterInstance`,
  `IdentityCenterPrincipal`/`IdentityCenterUser`/`IdentityCenterGroup`, `PermissionSet`, and
  `AccountAssignment`, plus `hasPermissionSet`/`assignsPermissionSet`/`assignsPrincipal`/
  `assignsToAccount` properties and example instances
- **Property hierarchy** (PRD REQ-024): eight previously-flat properties
  (`podRunsOn`, `runsOnCluster`, `usesContainerImage`, `hasNodeGroup`, `hasTaskDefinition`,
  `attachedTo`, `encryptedWith`, `routesTrafficThrough`) declared `rdfs:subPropertyOf` their
  generic superproperty (`dependsOn`, `uses`, or `contains`)
- **SHACL shapes** (PRD REQ-025): `ontology/aws.shapes.ttl` with closed-world validation shapes
  for `VPC`, `StepFunction`, `PermissionSet`, `AccountAssignment`, `S3Bucket`, and `IAMPolicy`,
  checked in CI via `tests/test_shacl_validation.py` (new `pyshacl` dependency)
- **PROV-O alignment** (PRD REQ-026): `AWSResource rdfs:subClassOf prov:Entity`;
  `ModelInvocation rdfs:subClassOf prov:Activity`
- **SKOS concept scheme** (PRD REQ-027): `AWSResourceCategoryScheme` with the 9 top-level
  resource categories punned as `skos:Concept` (legal OWL 2 DL class/individual punning) —
  a browsable taxonomy orthogonal to the strict `owl:disjointWith` partitioning
- **Modern Python toolchain**: `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621) as the canonical dependency
  manifest with a `uv.lock` lockfile; ruff replaces black/isort/flake8/mypy; pytest runs
  the suite (`make test`, `make lint`, `make format`)
- **GitHub Actions CI**: lint + test matrix (Python 3.11/3.14) + TTL/OWL sync verification
  on every push and pull request
- **CLI smoke tests** (`tests/test_tools_smoke.py`): every tool must answer `--help` and
  byte-compile — guards against the argparse-crash class of bug
- **OWL 2 DL compliance tests** (`tests/test_dl_compliance.py`): undeclared-term references
  and illegal axiom constructs (e.g. inverse-functional datatype properties) now fail CI

- **PRD-required IAM properties** (closes drift alerts REQ-009/REQ-010): `canAssumeRole`
  (IAM principal → assumable role) and `hasPolicy` (declared `owl:equivalentProperty` to the
  existing `hasPolicyAttachment`)
- **PRD v1.2, then v1.3**: all testable requirements now carry stable `REQ-NNN` identifiers used
  by drift tooling; scope updated to reflect implemented service coverage (including this
  release's AI/GenAI and Identity Center additions)

### Removed
- Dead code: `utils/config_validation.py` (296 lines, never imported), `mypy.ini`,
  `.coveragerc` (coverage config folded into `pyproject.toml`)

### Fixed
- **Ontology axioms**: Declared previously-missing `belongsToRegion` object property
  (was referenced only by VPC's cardinality restriction)
- **OWL 2 DL compliance**: Removed illegal `owl:InverseFunctionalProperty` typing from the
  `arn` datatype property; ARN uniqueness is now expressed with a DL-legal `owl:hasKey`
  axiom on `AWSResource`
- **Version metadata**: `owl:versionInfo` synchronized with CHANGELOG (0.4.0 → 0.4.2)
- **Documentation accuracy**: Corrected example-instance count (115 typed individuals, not
  535+), fixed README quick-example to use the real `encrypted` property, refreshed stale
  class/property counts, and corrected CHANGELOG release dates to match git history
- **Tooling**: Fixed `--quiet` argparse crash in `tools/monitor_aws_changes.py`; removed
  hardcoded ArangoDB password fallback in `tools/import_to_arangodb.py`
- **Example data gaps surfaced by SHACL**: `ProductionVPC` was missing both `:arn` and
  `:belongsToRegion` despite the latter being required by `VPC`'s cardinality restriction since
  the previous release; `DevOpsCustomPolicy` had a free-text `:policyDocument` but no structured
  `:hasStatement` link to its existing `:AllowEC2Describe` statement. Both fixed. The broader gap
  (most pre-2026 example individuals predate `:arn`) is tracked as a Warning-severity SHACL
  finding rather than backfilled wholesale — see the shapes file header for rationale.

## Migration Notes

### From v0.5.0 to v0.6.0
- Replace the namespace `http://www.semanticweb.org/aws-ontology#` with
  `https://w3id.org/arango-solutions/aws-ontology#` in data and queries (a plain text
  substitution is sufficient).
- Policy statement data: rename `aws:hasResource` to `aws:hasStatementResource` where the
  subject is a `PolicyStatement`.
- Security group rules linked with `aws:memberOf` should use `aws:securityGroupRuleOf`.
- Data that relied on `aws:appliesTo` running from a resource to its security group should be
  reversed (security group → resource).

### From v0.1.0 to v0.2.0
- No breaking changes
- All v0.1.0 queries remain compatible
- New IAM capabilities available
- Examples significantly expanded
